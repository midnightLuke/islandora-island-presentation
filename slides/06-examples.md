# <!-- .element: style="text-shadow: -5px 0 black, 0 5px black, 5px 0 black, 0 -5px black;" --> What Can Drupal Do?


## Modules

- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Modules are the main building blocks of a site
- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Islandora is simply a module, as are solution packs

Notes:

- Extra dependencies can be a pain to install/manage


## Theming

- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Robust theme layer
- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Most things can be changing "last-minute" here

Notes:

- But they _shouldn't_ be.


## Caching

- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Drupal not known to be the fastest out of the box, but many ways to make Drupal sites blazingly fast
- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Swappable cache backends
- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Easy to use cache API for developers


## Configuration

- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> You can manipulate almost _any_ setting in the admin UI
- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Sites can be built without any coding
- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> In Drupal 8 "configuration entities" are a thing

Notes:

- Configuration entities are awesome
  - Can be dumped to YAML files on the filesystem for easy git integration


## And a lot more...

- Drupal can be a web service back-end
- Drupal can be a full-stack solution for a website
- Drupal can serve as an application framework
- Drupal can integrate with 3rd party applications
- Drupal distributions allow special-purpose, ready-made Drupal installs
