# What Can Islandora Do?


# Not a lot!

Notes:

- Almost nothing without some help, the basic stack provides APIs for solution
packs to provide extra functionality


## Solution Packs

- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Out of the box Islandora doesn't do alot
- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Solution packs add "_cmodels_" and "_viewers_" for specific types of archival objects
- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Solution Packs typically have extra dependencies for ingesting/viewing/derivative generation

Notes:

- Extra dependencies can be a pain to install/manage


## Object Model

- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Typically presented as a "tree" structure
- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Really a graph structure (objects can have multiple parents)
- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> RELS-EXT datastream defines relationships

Notes:

- Think of a file system, where a directory can have files and sub-directories


## Metadata

- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Uses MODS records (librarians like these)
- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> DC datastreams are crosswalked automatically from MODS
- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Citations can be generated from MODS with Islandora Scholar Solution Pack


## Image Archiving

- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Large Image Solution Pack for JP2000, tiffs, etc
- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Basic Image Solution Pack for png, jpg, gifs, etc


## And a lot more...

- PDFs
- Websites
- Documents
- Citations
- Entities (People/Places/Organizations)
- etc...
