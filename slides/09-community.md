# The Drupal Community


## Islandora is just a name

- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> We can be better members of the Drupal community
- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> We can do _a lot more_ with Drupal

Notes:

- Made up of vendors, freelancers, insitutions, just about everyone.
- They can help the Islandora community, but only if we join them.
- More vendors and Drupal experience will help this community grow
- Most development proceeds on github
- It would be nice to get these as projects on drupal.org
