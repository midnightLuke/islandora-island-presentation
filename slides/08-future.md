## Islandora CLAW

- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> CLAW is the codename for the 2.x version of Islandora
- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Started on Drupal 7, has pivoted to Drupal 8 now
- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Focus on being less tied to the monolithic stack, uses "microservices" to accomplish most tasks
- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Better use of Drupal's APIs and core functions (Fedora Objects are mapped to Drupal Entities)
- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Uses Fedora 4.x

Notes:

- Fedora 4.x is a large departure from 3.x
  - Uses RDF to describe everything
